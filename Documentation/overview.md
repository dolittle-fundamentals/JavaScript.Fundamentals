The JavaScript Fundamentals consists of a set of packages that provide a set of
common utilities, building blocks and helpers. Each package very specifically
targeting a concrete topic, often at times isolated for its purpose. This makes
it very modular and easy to pull in just the functionality you want and nothing
more.

These fundamental pieces also represents an implementation of the core principles
we at Dolittle believe in.
