A subject in a [rule]({{< relref rule >}}) is the thing that gets evaluated. This could be
a complex type like an **Object** or a primitive like a **Number** or **String**.
During evaluation of a [rule set]({{< relref rule_set >}}), this subject gets used on all
rules during evalution of the **rule set**.
